Book of the Damned
==================

# Purpose
**The Book of the Damned** is a foundational framework for building an enriching and connected social haven for those who need it. It's a shared cosmology and mythos for morality outside religious contexts and constraints. The expectation is a community that builds upon itself and evolves over time to serve the needs of its members and broader society.

I've used some spare time to hobble together a hodgepodge of cultural knowledge, quantum mechanics, philosophy, and personal observations into a layman's text that I'm placing into the public domain, in the hopes that it grows into something larger.

This book is open. The text is public domain. The idea is that each follower may make a copy for themselves and modify it however they see fit. If they want to share those modifications, then others may copy the modifications they've made.

Ideally, we don't try to convert people. We don't have authority figures to interpret "scripture." We CAN form communities to help one another socially, but not correct others' interpretations. The journey is for the individual. It is through self-improvement that the community is improved.

Our gatherings should encourage social discourse.

The basic premise being: Since I haven't had the same life experiences as you, your copy of the book should never look exactly like mine. But open dialog allows us to discuss our points of view and take the views of others to our own books.

I'd also like to encourage learning to play the game of Go. Not as an edict, but as a cultural foundation and mental cultivation for us, as a group. If you can master such a game, you can master anything life throws at you.

Enjoy the philosophy!

# Preamble: In principio erat Verbum
```
In the beginning is the Word,
And the Word is with God,
And the Word is God.
The two are inseparable.

And the Word, being all things,
And having no place to go,
Resounded into itself.
Giving shape and form,
To all that is.
Every person, place, thought, thing, or potential.

The Word is Truth.

Truth knows all things.
Has all power.
And is everywhere.

Truth is a fractal,
Eternally imposing upon,
And receding into itself.
Changing one aspect,
Changes the entire thing.
Each part,
The encapsulation of the whole in its entirety.

This Truth is always with me.

Do not denounce your humanity.
For, it was given to you by Truth.
We struggle not against our own natures,
But in understanding them,
And how the Lie can use them against us.

In times of despair, dream.
The entire world was dreamt up by someone.
Dreams are just as true as anything else.

Dream, and have faith.

You are a child of Providence.
You are a child of Possible.

So is everything else.
```

# Obligations
The Damned are a solitary order with 3 primary obligations:

1. Ten percent of everything which comes to them must be donated back to their communities.
2. Public discussion is to be encouraged and embraced.
3. They are to speak to their hearts daily.

# The Immutable Truth
Three Immutable attributes are often given to God. These are: omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience.

- The Truth can never be manipulated nor changed, not even by a deity. Truth is omnipotent.
- In a universe made entirely of lies, where up is down and down is up, Truth can quickly be determined. Truth is omnipresent.
- Newton's Third Law of Motion states that, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Assuming this to be true, one truth always leads to another. Meaning every truth is entirely contained within every other. Truth is omniscient.

Further, if for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, then the entirety of the universe pushes your foot into the sand, and leaves a print. And that push affirms a counter universe with all the potentials of this one. The energy expelled by putting your foot in the sand doesn't just disappear. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. The place where those two universes meet solidifies them both into existence.

In essence, Truth is a fractal, reaching out to touch itself on all sides, throughout many dimensions. Infinitely assertive and infinitely receptive. The points of intersection creating reality. The reverberating pattern, manifesting everything and everyone. Changing the fractal in the slightest, changes it for everyone. Your actions affect the furthermost stars.

With every connection, there is an equal and opposite obstruction. Because of this, you are as much Truth as you are yourself. You're just as ignorant as you are knowledgeable. We can only imagine other potentials, because they're obstructed from us, but every one of them is equally as real and every obstruction just as penetrable.

A unifying theory of everything. An equation to explain the unfolding of existence in a small and neatly wrapped package. A god. A word. A breath. A sword. A shield. It doesn't echo through us. It is us. It is the present, the past, the future. It's all that is, ever will be, or ever could be, wrapped into a single point -- all happening at once. And you carry that with you everywhere.

It is Truth which makes peace, and fans the flames of war. It is Truth which evokes passion and desire within the hearts of men. It is Truth which gives these things purpose.

You are the Truth in its entirety. So is everything else. The prince and the pauper. The child and the dogshit on the side of the road.

Is a human life worth a book? What if it were thousands of years old, the only one of its kind, and told your family legacy? If it were a religious artifact and inside a burning museum?

A millennias old tome has now taken the value of a human life. Just because it's old and contains information someone treasures. Dogshit on Mars provides nutrients for growing plants.

Everything in the multiverse has the same presence; everything in the multiverse is singularily the same Truth.

The janitor and the CEO? One cannot exist without the other. The janitor exists because the CEO. The CEO exists because of the janitor. Both jobs exist because of the building. The building exists because people need jobs and services. The multiverse cares not that it is clean and managed. And yet, it does.

All Truth converges on a single point. Every side, with equal strength, reinforcing the others and solidifying them. Every side equally existent before converging with any other.

What you do to one thing, you do to everything.

# The Solitudes

1. Your brokenness isn't a sign of being broken, but of a healthy mind reacting to unhealthy circumstances.
2. There's no shame in failure; it's part of the journey.
3. You are not lost; you're right here, in this moment. Breathe.
4. In a universe of lies, Truth quickly becomes apparent.
5. Your voice, mind, and the Truth are your strongest weapons.
6. A lie can run circles around the Truth, but can never change it.
7. The difference between lie and fantasy is that while lie seeks destruction, fantasy seeks survival.
8. To whom much is given, much is required; it is the responsibility of the strong to protect the weak. All are Truth.
9. Ownership is an illusion: You're born with nothing; you die with nothing. Truth lends itself to your care as you lend yourself to its.
10. The King is nothing without his subjects; The subjects are defenseless without their king. Each part equally serves the whole.
11. All things around you, being Truth, have consciousness, because you, being Truth, have consciousness.
12. The worst atrocities are committed by people looking to help; If you can't put yourself in someone else's shoes, you don't know what they truly want or need.
13. What you do not reconcile, you pass on; commune with your heart.
14. Prepare your children for a world without you.
15. Pointing your finger at others leaves 3 more pointed back at yourself.
16. There's always someone better than you.
17. Any man who claims to speak for the Truth is a liar; and all liars speak Truth.
18. The Lie says, "Truth doesn't exist." When confronted, it claims to always have been. The Lie is just as old as the Truth -- it is Truth. But it is also the Lie.
19. The Lie is its own undoing.
20. No matter how much you fight, Truth always emerges.
21. You shall know Truth by its ring.
22. The past forms the present; the future shapes the past. All is Truth.
23. A fair trade comes at a loss to both sides: A trader values what they're getting more than what they're losing.
24. Apologize for your transgressions against others and make appropriate restitutions at your loss.
25. This path is for you alone; it is yours to follow, and yours to abandon.
26. This text is words. It accomplishes nothing without the heart.
27. Take responsibility for the world around you. If not you, then who?
28. The weight of the entire multiverse bears down on you. You're asserting equally as much in return by your existence alone. The multiverse is what it is because of you.
29. All things, being Truth, are equal in power and weakness. Person, place, thing, thought, group, or idea. None has anymore Truth than the other. Figure out how to use yours.
30. Because of obstruction, every weakness has an equal and opposite strength. Every strength has an equal and opposite weakness.
31. There is power in weakness.
32. Cruelty is the heart crying out for Truth, while the Lie beats it relentlessly for doing so. That's how the Lie passes from thing to thing. It convinces Truth it isn't real.
33. Cruelty is the refuge of the weak and feeble minded. Unable to fend for themselves, they resort to grandstanding.
34. Criticism is the expectation of betterment. And to what end?
35. Fear is the beginning of wisdom; fear of the Truth is the beginning of the Lie.
36. Anyone wanting to defeat the Lie should listen to what it says.
37. Be mindful of the food you eat.
38. Those who want peace should prepare for war.
39. Truth manifests in each of us our own gifts.
40. Slow dedicated quality will always outshine rushed batched quantity; both come at a cost.
41. Do not allow the Lie to taint your gifts: Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.
42. The Lie thrives in the hearts of men when they aren't connected to the Truth, or themselves.
43. Evil justifies its actions as necessary.
44. Truth is beyond numbering, tribal markings, or dedications.
45. Truth has neither will nor intent; all  is its nature.
46. Why share something if it can't be used?
47. Competition breeds innovation; it also breeds cheating.
48. Listen.
49. No two words carry the same meaning.
50. Truth is with you in your suffering.
51. A man who is scared of himself will be scared of others. The self touches the other and finds Truth.
52. Learn to heal yourself from those whom life has broken.
53. Do one thing every day that scares you; a sense of awe keeps the spirits up.
54. There is a time for superficialities, but true awareness lies deep below the surface.
55. Advancement is not permission to 
56. It's possible to do everything right and still lose.
57. It doesn't go away just because you refuse to see it.
58. Get up and do it again.

# The Divinity
It is through infinite recession that Truth births all. Not absence, but potential. And through infinite assertion, she gives form. Solid and unyielding.

Both, the same Truth.

Resting upon a table asserts force upon it. But the table, having form, asserts upon you too. How is it then, that your effort traverses this boundary and gets distributed to the floor?

How much more does your own essence bypass all obstruction and radiate throughout all things?

```
Truth is all things, and nothing.
She, by her very nature,
Births the stars,
And gives them the freedom to shine.
Ever present and nowhere.
At the dawn of time while simultaneously observing its demise.
Nursing all.
Knowing their names before they're even formed.

And as point leads to point,
She traverses it all in an instant.
Penetrating all obstruction by virtue alone.

All-knowing, all-powerful, and all-present.

Always with you.
Always in you.
And always you.
```

# On Evolution
The animal kingdom doesn't kill the weak; it kills the different.

A flock of birds will gang up on and kill a single bird with brighter feathers. No matter how much it fights back, the flock gains no more respect for that bird.

Killing the weak usually results in the death of the species.

Why? Because from an evolutionary standpoint there's no such thing as weakness. You can't prove a negative. You can't prove the absence of strength. Only the absence of fitness for a particular purpose.

But there is such a thing as being different. Animals who are different make the group stand out to predators. Someone who's different disturbs the order of things.

Humans cannot ignore the laws of Truth. They will keep popping up.

For each challenge, there evolves a demand for a solution. And as much as Truth demands homogeny, so too does Truth demand specialization.

Truth spits out all the random potentials it can. Then challenges their existence with other random potentials.

Parts of Truth which fail the challenge are obstructed.

In the beginning of us, the essentials for life came about many times. It wasn't until Truth added a desire to feed and remain alive that life became more complex. The challenge, in this case, was the desire to stay cohesive -- something with which every lifeform is endowed.

As cells warred against one another, complex Truth systems -- already in existence -- began to rear themselves. Teams and partnerships emerged as multicellular organisms could consume more of their competition -- it is from these wars that we gain our emotions. Primitive logical structures which bridge the conceptual and the physical. The necessity with the meaning.

But the challenge is unknowable, so too is the solution. Truth produces variance because every variation is a solution to some unknowable challenge.

There are still single-celled organisms today, because Truth never lost a use for them. Viruses and bacteria can take down entire multicellular organisms, because they're small enough to infiltrate said organisms.

Strength in the group fails against the very thing which built it -- the individual. With every strength, there is an equal and opposite weakness. It is beyond us to determine the usefulness of a thing. Some diseases kill the young and leave the old. Some target less healthy.

All are Truth. All have strength and purpose.

# On People
Everything has 2 innate rights given it by Truth: 

1. The right to assert its own existence
2. The right to take in the existence of others

This can be broadened into a more general set of principles for human-beings:

1. The right to life and self-defense
2. The right to express oneself and be informed
3. The right to self-determination and responsibility
4. The right to privacy and free affiliation 
5. The right to liberty and justice

These are the foundation of a free society. Refusing these rights to any person is an affront to Truth itself. It is the job of all people to protect and affirm these rights for everyone.

# Forgiveness, Life, and Death

Truth knew you before it came together and formed you. Everything is always a potential outcome. And Truth has already manifested all outcomes. All potentials have been played out, side-by-side, in an instant.

Truth is both inside and outside of time. What takes centuries for us to learn, Truth just knows. The purpose of our existence is to affirm what Truth already knows. We are the proof behind the concept.

Because all things are Truth, death is an illusion. We lose our external sensory inputs, but we never cease to exist as an eternal concept, made manifest in Truth.

Every interaction we had with the multiverse will continue long after our identities have been obstructed from this reality.

And, as negative space provides mechanical function, so too do the interactions you've had leave a complete inverse of you behind. That inverse is as real as anything else. You existed before you were formed. And you exist after. So does everything.

---

The greatest surgeon in the world abuses his wife. Do you imprison him? How many children will die because of you? If he beats his wife to death, how many will go uninspired, having never seen her art? What you do to one, you do to all.

Be responsible in your dealings.

# On God

There seems to be an order to all of this. Just as the desire for cohesion eventually arose from randomness -- it was the only thing which could -- so too do pre-established rules arise from freedom. And we seem not to be able to proceed without acknowledging them. A desire for cohesion and stasis from fundamental forces, before life can begin.

Laws, like Newton's where every action has an equal reaction, leading to even greater truths. Like the requirement of everything having its entire history -- and the history of all others -- encoded within itself.

Or, that everything you put out affects the target, the society, and you. The instant you put it out, you create its image inside yourself.

Or, the instability of certain nations, because of injustice. Those injustices will forever be recorded in Truth, and will continue to pop up until they are resolved.

Call this God, or science. In absolute chaos, there are rules... An oreder to things. And these rules reach down to us, as we reach up to them. We reach up to something greater and larger than ourselves. Believing,  in full faith, that by trusting them, tomorrow will be better than today.
